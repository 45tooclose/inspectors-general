#
# This list contains handles for inspector general scrapers that are sufficiently
# stable that a production app depending on this project could lean on this list.
#
# Generally, this means that the scraper has successfully completed a "dry run"
# since its earliest year. (Scrapes the whole site, but does not download PDFs.)
#
# For example:
#   ./inspectors/fcc.py --dry_run --since=1994
#
# Data from this run will be casually reviewed for quality. Inclusion here
# does *not* mean that the data quality has been fully vetted, only that it is
# acceptably unlikely that you will experience crashes or see broken data.
#
# To run only scrapers that appear on this list, run:
#    ./igs --safe
